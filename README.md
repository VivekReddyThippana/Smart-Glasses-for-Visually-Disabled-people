# Smart Glasses for Visually Disabled people
 Developed Raspberry Pi-based smart glasses designed to detect obstacles and provide real-time voice alerts for enhanced mobility. Integrated ultrasonic sensors capable of detecting objects within a 4-meter range, ensuring timely awareness of potential hazards.  Implemented text-to-speech (TTS) technology to convert sensor data into voice alerts, allowing users to receive distance information via earphones. Used Python scripts to process real-time sensor inputs, optimize response time, and generate accurate voice outputs.  Designed the device to be lightweight and hands-free, offering a practical assistive solution for individuals with visual impairments.
